def ind2ptr(ind: Tensor, num_rows: int) -> Tensor:
    """Convert sorted row indices to a CSR row-pointer tensor.

    Drop-in replacement for ``torch.ops.torch_sparse.ind2ptr(ind, M)`` on Ascend NPU.
    The second argument is the row count (historically named ``M`` in torch_sparse).

    Launches asynchronously on the current NPU stream (same as pytorch_sparse CUDA).
    Synchronize with ``torch.npu.synchronize()`` / ``torch.npu.current_stream().synchronize()``
    before reading results on host if needed.

    Args:
        ind (Tensor): 1-D ``torch.long`` tensor of non-decreasing row indices on NPU.
        num_rows (int): Number of rows. Output length is ``num_rows + 1``.

    Returns:
        Tensor: 1-D ``torch.long`` CSR pointer of shape ``[num_rows + 1]`` on NPU.

    Example:
        >>> import torch
        >>> import ops_gnn
        >>> row = torch.tensor([2, 2, 4, 5, 5, 6], dtype=torch.long, device='npu')
        >>> ops_gnn.ind2ptr(row, 8)
        tensor([0, 0, 0, 2, 2, 3, 5, 6, 6], device='npu:0')
